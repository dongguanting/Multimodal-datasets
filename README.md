# Multimodal datasets

This repository is build in association with our position paper on "Multimodality for NLP-Centered Applications: Resources, Advances and
Frontiers".

As a part of this release we share the information about recent multimodal datasets which are available for research purposes.

We found that although 100+ multimodal language resources are available in literature for various NLP tasks, still publicly available multimodal datasets are under-explored for its re-usage in subsequent problem domains.
